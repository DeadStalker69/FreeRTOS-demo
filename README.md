# FreeRTOS-demo RP2040

The given code is vanilla FreeRTOS. The code is an INO file (runs on Arduino IDE). Hence, it is universal and can be used with any micro-controller that can be interfaced with Arduino IDE.

P.S.: The code logic is universal but some libraries and function names may need to be changed according to the micro-controller and FreeRTOS version used.
